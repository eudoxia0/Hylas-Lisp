Integers
^^^^^^^^

Integer types are denoted by the letter 'i' followed by the integer's
bit-width. The following integer types are supported:

* `i1`
* `i8`
* `i16`
* `i32`
* `i64`
* `i128`

The symbol `word` is aliased to the integer type that represents a machine
word. In 64-bit systems, this is usually `i64`.
