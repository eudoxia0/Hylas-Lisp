# If you are here, you were probably looking for Hylas Lisp

This project is being rewritten. Please check back in a few megaseconds.

# What is this?

A statically-typed, low-level dialect of Lisp that targets LLVM.

# Why?

The era of dynamic languages if over. There is currently a 'race to the bottom':
Languages like [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[Nimrod](http://nimrod-lang.org/) are merging the world of low-level programming
with high-level compiler features. [cmacro](https://github.com/eudoxia0/cmacro)
is another one of my contributions to this movement.

# Features

* Static typing with partial inference.
* Manual memory management with multiple safety guarantees.
* Common Lisp Conditions and Restarts for error handling.
* Macros and Common Lisp-style reader macros.
* Runtime optional.

# Anti-Features

* Garbage Collection.
* Exceptions.

# Status

See the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/1W0DdGwx/corvus).

Please don't post this on Hacker News yet.

# Notes

This project was originally called Hylas Lisp. I have been working on it on and
off since early 2012, but I've wanted something along these lines for a much
longer time. It was originally written in C++, then in Common Lisp. Third time's
the charm ðŸ˜¹.

The original repository was overwritten because I wanted a clean slate. I hope
the code, in this third iteration, is to your liking. I have tried my best to
write clean, concise code and comments.

There will eventually be a language reference and manual. For now, most of the
documentation on the compiler implementation is available as comments throughout
the source code.
